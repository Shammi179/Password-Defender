<h1 align="center"><b>Password Defender</br></h1>
(A password generator and storage application)

## About Project
<p>
In this project, we have implemented a password generator and password defender. To use this application, a user must have to create an account where he/she has to give an email address and set a Master Password and in future the user has to login with this master password to do perform any action. we have implemented a password generator which has 3 categories (Average, Strong, Very Strong). For more safety and security, we should use the very strong option as well as a length of at least 16 characters. In this system, a user can save his/her other passwords as well as any new passwords and generate them easily and for this they have to save this password using website and username so that he can get this password by using website name. A user can easily update his/her password verifying Master Password.</p>
